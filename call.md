		<h3>Audience</h3>
		<p>The workshop encourages designers, artists, writers, film-makers, architects, philosophers, psychologists, computer scientists and engineers, to speculate on alternative metaphors for human-robot interaction. It lays the foundation for a more nuanced perspective on how to design interactions with robots beyond the current, singular notion of anthropomorphism for embodied interaction.</p>
