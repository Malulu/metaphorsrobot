		<h3>Audience</h3>
		<p align="justify">This workshop encourages designers, artists, writers, film-makers, architects, philosophers, psychologists, computer scientists, and engineers, to speculate on alternative metaphors for human-robot interactions. We aim to create a space for discussing different perspectives on how to design social robots that goes beyond the current, singular notion of social robots.</p>
