[Dan Lockton](https://danlockton.com/about/) is a British interaction designer and researcher, and founder of the Imaginaries Lab. He is currently an assistant professor in the School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University, and a Faculty Affiliate of the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, and was formerly Chair of Design Studies (2017–20). He holds a PhD in Design from Brunel University, London, an MPhil in Technology Policy from the University of Cambridge, a BSc in Industrial Design Engineering, also from Brunel, and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (2008–). Dan is also a member of the Design Research Society’s new International Advisory Council (2020–).

Dan’s research focuses on the links between design, understanding, imaginaries, and human action, particularly in relation to social and environmental benefit, drawing on influences from a range of fields including behavioral and decision sciences, human-computer interaction, pattern languages and cybernetics. He’s interested in questions of how we interpret, imagine and interact with the world—institutions, the environment, cities, infrastructures, technologies and complex systems around us—how they, in turn, model us, and what the consequences could be for design which seeks to enable human agency as part of a transition to more sustainable futures. Dan is currently writing a book on these topics, based on the Design with Intent toolkit.
