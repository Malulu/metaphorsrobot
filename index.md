Until now, most approaches in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) were centered around a single metaphor, striving towards a human-like, utilitarian, can-do-it-all robot. While this strategy has advantages, it also places unrealistic expectations for robots, which frequently result in disappointment when interacting with them. In this workshop, we call for exploring alternative designs for social robots to cultivate new perspectives on robots, outside the existing norms. Alternative metaphors have been previously successful in breaking through fixation and bringing novel design and products.  Furthermore, metaphors can serve as a vessel to wider societal imaginaries of technology and progress. 

The aim of this half-day workshop is to use metaphors to reinvent how robots can interact with humans, re-imagine alternative physical shapes for robots, and open up a conversation about the role robots might have in societies. Our goal is to create a “Collection of Metaphors” that could be used within the field of HRI and to other relevant intersection fields. This collection will be shared with the community, and will provide a reference for alternative designs and interactions between humans and robots.
