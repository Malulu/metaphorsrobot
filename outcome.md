			<h2>Collection of Human-Robot Interaction Metaphors</h2>
		</header>
		<p>This is the 1st Edition of the "Metaphors for Human-Robot Interaction" Workshop, in which metaphors will be used to reinvent how robots can interact with humans, re-imagine alternative physical shapes for robots, and open up a conversation about the role robots might have in societies. Our goal is to create a "Collection of Metaphors" that could be used within the field of Human-Robot Interaction and to other relevant intersection fields. This Collection will be shared with the community, and will provide a reference for alternative designs and interactions between humans and robots.</p>
