		<p align="justify">Our goal is to create a "Collection of Robot Metaphors" that could be used within the field of Human-Robot Interaction and to other relevant intersection fields. This Collection will be shared with the community and will provide a reference for alternative designs and interactions between humans and robots.</p>
		
<h3><i>The Collection will be made publicly available after the workshop date.</i></h3>
