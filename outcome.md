			<h2>Collection of Metaphors for Human-Robot Interactions</h2>
		</header>
		<p>The main goal of this workshop is to use metaphors to reinvent how robots can interact with humans, re-imagine alternative physical shapes for robots, and open up a conversation about the role robots might have in societies. Our goal is to create a "Collection of Metaphors" that could be used within the field of Human-Robot Interaction and to other relevant intersection fields. This Collection will be shared with the community, and will provide a reference for alternative designs and interactions between humans and robots.</p>
		
<h3><i>The Collection will be make publicly available here after the workshop date.</i></h3>
